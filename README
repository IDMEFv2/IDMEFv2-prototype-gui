Prewikka Overview
=================

Originally written by Markus Alkio and Miika Keskinen, re-written and maintained by 
Nicolas Delon with the help of Yoann Vandoorselaere and Audrey Girard, on behalf of

Prewikka is a professional looking application providing advanced features like
contextual filtering, aggregation, etc.
